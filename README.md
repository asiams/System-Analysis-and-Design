# System-Analysis-and-Design
Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
What did you do particularly well?
# The DriverPass project focused on creating a digital platform to support students in getting ready for their driving exams. The client requested a system that would allow users to sign up, book driving lessons, and schedule exams—all in one convenient place. One aspect I executed particularly well was designing an intuitive and organized diagrams, along with implementing a feature that lets users easily report technical problems, ensuring efficient support and uninterrupted access to the system.
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
# I would definently revise my diagrams and add more detail, also make the lines more organized.
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
# To understand the user's needs, I put myself in the shoes of a student getting ready for a driving test. I prioritized features that would make their experience smoother, such as straightforward sign-up, and a hassle-free way to book lessons and exams. Taking the time to identify what users truly need is crucial in system design because it leads to solutions that are easy to use, meet real-world expectations, and provide a better overall experience.
How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
# My approach to software design begins with identifying what the users need by collecting input through surveys, discussions, or observing how they interact with similar systems. Once I have a clear understanding, I break the project down into manageable parts and outline how each section should operate. I will use visual tools like wireframes, activity diagrams, and use case scenarios to plan the system’s structure and flow. Also, moving forward, I plan to rely on methods such as UML modeling for detailed planning, agile practices for adaptive development, and early user feedback to ensure the design is both practical and user-focused.
